# item-counter
I was packing clothes (since I will be moving to my university's residence in a few days) and thought, 
<i>"it would be kind of nice if there was something that allowed me to create different labels and counts for each on my webpage".</i>

Naturally, instead of Googling a multi-item counter or tallying on paper like a logical individual making efficient use of his or her time, I decided to code a static site.

<b>Note:</b> the counter uses local storage. The toggle under the title gives the following options in order: dark/light mode, new counter, edit, save, and clear all. <br>
